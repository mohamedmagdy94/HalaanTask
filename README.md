# HalaanTask
This is halaan Task <br />
-Notes: <br />
1)I have used VIPER pattern becuase it fits more to modularity <br />
2)I have divied the app into 4 projects (container project + 3 pods) <br />
3)Halaan Entities represent common structs and classed shared between pods <br />
4)Halaan Presentation Pod represent Presenter + View Layers <br />
5)Halaan Bussiness Pod represent Bussiness + Data Layers. <br />
6)I have used a mock service for posting tweets, because twitter requires more than 48 hours to give an API key and using their SDKs. <br />
7) I have included on unit test and UI test as a Proof of concept (POC). <br />
8) Kindly install pods and start the task from halaan task project
