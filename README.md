# HalaanTask
This is halaan Task
-Notes:
1)I have used VIPER pattern becuase it fits more to modularity
2)I have divied the app into 4 projects (container project + 3 pods)
3)Halaan Entities represent common structs and classed shared between pods
4)Halaan Presentation Pod represent Presenter + View Layers
5)Halaan Bussiness Pod represent Bussiness + Data Layers.
6)I have used a mock service for posting tweets, because twitter requires more than 48 hours to give an API key and using their SDKs.
7) I have included on unit test and UI test as a Proof of concept (POC).
